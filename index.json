We show that using information from pervasive Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices can enhance GPS and geographic information to improve transportation detection on smartphones. Wi-Fi information also improves the identification of transportation mode and helps conserve battery since it is already collected by most mobile phones. Our approach uses a machine learning approach to determine the mode from pre-prepocessed data. This approach yields an overall accuracy of 89% and average F1 score of 83% for inferring the three grouped modes of self-powered, car-based, and public transportation. When broken out by individual modes, Wi-Fi features improve detection accuracy of bus trips, train travel, and driving compared to GPS features alone and can substitute for GIS features without decreasing performance. Our results suggest that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be useful in urban transportation research, for example by improving mobile travel surveys and urban sensing applications.","tags":null,"title":"Inferring transportation mode from smartphone sensors: Evaluating the potential of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen","Asger Andersen","Kelton Ray Minor","David Dreyer Lassen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589932800,"objectID":"7bc65fdac82df56d37866e50fc301de3","permalink":"https://abjer.github.io/publication/bjerre-2020-smartphone/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bjerre-2020-smartphone/","section":"publication","summary":"This study monitored 470 university students' smartphone usage continuously over two years to assess the relationship between in-class smartphone use and academic performance. We utilize a novel dataset where smartphone use and grades were recorded across multiple courses, allowing us to examine this relationship at the student level and the student-in-course level. In accordance with the existing literature, we find that students’ in-class smartphone use is negatively associated to their grades, even when controlling for a broad range of observed student characteristics. However, the magnitude of the association decreases substantially in a fixed effects model, which leverages the panel structure of the data to control for all stable student and course characteristics, including those not observed by researchers. This suggests that the size of the effect of smartphone usage on academic performance is overestimated by studies that only control for observed student characteristics.","tags":null,"title":"The negative effect of smartphone use on academic performance may be overestimated: evidence from a two-year panel study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"a7cf84bd3a36b3ce4955d99f1e264624","permalink":"https://abjer.github.io/publication/bjerre-2020-assortative/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T14:35:15.885682Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bjerre-2020-assortative/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates endogenous network formation by heterogeneous agents. The agents' types determine the value of linking and we incorporate spillovers as  utility from indirect connections. We provide sufficient conditions for a class of networks with sorting to be stable for low to moderate spillovers; with only two types these networks are the unique pairwise stable ones. We also show that this sorting is suboptimal for moderate to high spillovers despite otherwise obeying the conditions for sorting in Becker 1973. This shows that in our sorted networks a tension between stability and efficiency is present.

To provide causal evidence on this question we employ novel data with unprecedented detail on the universe of Danish children and exploit changes in attendance boundaries over time.

There is a strong social gradient in defiance, as resourceful households are more sensitive to the student composition of schools.

Existing research indicates that class attendance is a useful predictor of subsequent course achievements. The majority of the literature is, however, based on surveys and self-reports, methods which have well-known systematic biases that lead to limitations on conclusions and generalizability as well as being costly to implement. Here we propose a novel method for measuring class attendance that overcomes these limitations by using location and bluetooth data collected from smartphone sensors. Based on measured attendance data of nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, we demonstrate that early and consistent class attendance strongly correlates with academic performance. In addition, our novel dataset allows us to determine that attendance among social peers was substantially correlated (0.5), suggesting either an important peer effect or homophily with respect to attendance.","tags":null,"title":"Class attendance, peer similarity, and academic performance in a large field study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I was interviewed by the Danish newspaper Information about the possibilities of implementing a new school admissions procedure in Denmark to improve the match quality, see more here .
